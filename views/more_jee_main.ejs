          The Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development (now known as Ministry of

          The JEE (Main) is being conducted in multiple Sessions (February/March/April/May 2021) for admissions in the
          next academic session. The candidates will thus benefit in the following ways:
          <ol class="list-decimal px-10">
            <li style="list-style-position:outside;" >This will give multiple opportunities to the candidates to improve their scores in the examination if they
              fail to give their best in the first attempt without wasting their whole academic year.</li>
            <li>
              In first attempt, the students will get a first-hand experience of taking an examination and will know their
              mistakes which they can improve while attempting for the next time.
            </li>
            <li>
              This will reduce the chances of dropping a year and droppers would not have to waste a full year.
            </li>
            <li>
              If anyone missed the examination due to reasons beyond control, then he/she will not have to wait for one
              full year.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The studentâ€™s best of the 2021 NTA Scores will be considered for preparation of Merit List/ Ranking.
          <br>
          <br>
          The JEE Main 2021 will be conducted for three papers separately - Paper 1: BE/BTech, Paper 2A: BArch and Paper
          2B: BPlan.
